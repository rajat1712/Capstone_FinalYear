Limitations 
Although standard CSA offers a very simple
and efficient solution, still it has certain limitations when
solving complex tuning problems . The performance of CSA is sensitive to the initialization of its controlling parameters, namely AP and fl.
Therefore, results achieved vary based on the value of these parameters chosen as well as on the past experience.
Further, constant values of control parameters AP and fl
limit the proper exploring of search space in which good
solutions may be present.
Additionally, standard CSA shows premature convergence
and stagnation when applied to solve complex problems. To address these issues,
the performance of original CSA is enhanced to optimize
PID controller.
